<br />
<br />
3. View the baseline.txt file in your folder to see if all of the files are there.  In this example, I added an extra file, e.txt. <br/>

<br />
<br />
4. Create another file in the Files folder and run it, typing B to monitor any changes.  The program will alert that a new file, f.txt in this case, has been created.  Delete the file or create a baseline after.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
5. Modify one of the existing files.  In this case, I added a B character to the end of a.txt, which will change the file's hash value.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
6. Monitor changes again.  You will be alerted that the following file has been changed.  Change the file back or update the baseline to remove the alert.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
7. Delete one of the files.  In this case, I chose e.txt since I created it beforehand.  Run and monitor again, and you will see an alert that says that the file has been deleted.  <br/>

8. Run the file again and update the baseline again to restore it back to it's original state.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
9. You will see that there are now only 4 files in the baseline.  <br/>
